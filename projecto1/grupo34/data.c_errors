data.c: (in function data_create)
data.c:17:24: Null storage returned as non-null: NULL
  Function returns a possibly null pointer, but is not declared using
  /*@null@*/ annotation of result.  If function may return NULL, add /*@null@*/
  annotation to the return value declaration. (Use -nullret to inhibit warning)
data.c:20:29: Null storage returned as non-null: NULL
data.c:25:24: Function malloc expects arg 1 to be size_t gets int: size
  To allow arbitrary integral types to match any integral type, use
  +matchanyintegral.
data.c:28:10: Null storage returned as non-null: NULL
data.c:30:9: Returned storage *retVal contains 1 undefined field: data
  Storage derivable from a parameter, return value or global is not defined.
  Use /*@out@*/ to denote passed or returned storage which need not be defined.
  (Use -compdef to inhibit warning)
data.c: (in function data_create2)
data.c:37:27: Null storage returned as non-null: NULL
data.c:39:29: Null storage returned as non-null: NULL
data.c:40:29: Function memcpy expects arg 3 to be size_t gets int: size
data.c: (in function data_destroy)
data.c:49:7: Implicitly temp storage data2 passed as only param: free (data2)
  Temp storage (associated with a formal parameter) is transferred to a
  non-temporary reference. The storage may be released or new aliases created.
  (Use -temptrans to inhibit warning)
